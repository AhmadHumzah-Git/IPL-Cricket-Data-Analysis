# IPL-Cricket-Data-Analysis

This project involves analyzing IPL cricket data using MySQL. The goal is to derive meaningful insights from the data, such as player performance, team statistics, match outcomes, and other relevant metrics. This analysis helps in understanding various aspects of the game and identifying trends and patterns in IPL cricket matches.


## Features

- Analyze player performance.
- View team statistics.
- Get match outcomes and other relevant metrics.


## Tech 
- MySQL
- SQL

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AhmadHumzah-Git/IPL-Cricket-Data-Analysis.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd IPL-Cricket-Data-Analysis
   ```
3. **Import the SQL file into your MySQL database:**
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p new_project < ‪C:/Users/Ahmad Humzah/OneDrive/Desktop/Projects for Portfolio/MySQL/cricket_analysis.sql
   ```
    
## Usage/Examples

Once the SQL file is imported, you can run various queries to analyze the data. Here are some examples:

1. **Top Batsmen:**
   ```sql
   SELECT batsman,SUM(batsman_runs) AS Total_runs FROM new_project.deliveries GROUP BY batsman ORDER BY SUM(batsman_runs) DESC LIMIT 10;
   ```

2. **Top Bowlers:**
   ```sql
   SELECT bowler,SUM(is_wicket) AS Total_wickets FROM new_project.deliveries GROUP BY bowler ORDER BY SUM(is_wicket) DESC LIMIT 10;
   ```

3. **Match Outcomes:**
   ```sql
   SELECT id, team1, team2, winner FROM matches WHERE YEAR(date) = '2020';
   ```


## Roadmap

- Additional browser support.
- Add advanced analytics queries.
- Integrate data visualization tools.
